  description:
  - Bachelor Thesis written during my time as research assistant at the Research Campus STIMULATE & Department of Simulaton and Graphics at University Magdeburg, Germany
  - Academic research on the visualization of cerebral vessels with focus on the vessel walls
  - "Result: Interactive 3D visualization of a major component of the cerebral circulation to evaluate vessel radius and vessel wall thickness "
  - "Purpose: Improvement of the diagnosis and risk analysis of cerebrovascular diseases (e.g. aneurysms or stroke)"
  - "Background: recently enhanced imaging method Optical Coherence Tomography allows acquisition of the brain vessels, first project with this data visualised in 3D with meaningful parameters"
  - "Steps: <ol><li>Data Processing from OCT images</li><li>Building of a 3D model of the Circle of Willis (Major component of the cerebral circulation)</li><li>Color-coded mapping of evaluation parameters on model</li><li>Evaluation</li></ol>"
