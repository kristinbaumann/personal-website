aboutme:
- Hi, I am a <strong>Senior Frontend Developer</strong> with 4+ years practical experience in creating web applications.
- I successfully studied <strong>Computational Visualistics</strong>, which provided me with a profound computer science background and let me discover my passion for any kind of visual presentation, like building <strong>beautiful modern web applications</strong> or code complex <strong>data visualisations</strong>.
- I am a <strong>highly ambitious</strong> person, which motivates me to constantly <strong>improve my skills</strong>. While I am currently deep diving into the JavaScript UI Library <strong>React</strong> from tech side, I am also broadening my horizon by working in the field of <strong>design and user experience</strong>.
- I love travelling around the world, so I worked abroad in Australia and Vietnam. I am currently <strong>living in Berlin, Germany</strong>.
