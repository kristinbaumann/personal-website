aboutme:
  - Hi, I am a <strong>Senior Frontend Developer</strong> with 5+ years practical experience in creating web applications.
  - My Computational Visualistics studies provided me with a <strong>profound computer science background</strong> and let me discover my passion for anything visual in our digital world. Thus I like to build <strong>beautiful modern web applications</strong> or code complex <strong>data visualisations</strong>.
  - In terms of tech I am specialised in <strong>React JS</strong> about which I share my knowledge as a <strong>speaker at conferences</strong>. Nevertheless my interests go beyond coding, as I like to shape digital products by <strong>developing concepts</strong>, <strong>designing interfaces</strong> and <strong>testing with users</strong>.
  - I am currently living <strong>in Berlin, Germany</strong>.
