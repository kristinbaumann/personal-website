aboutme:
- Hi, my name is Kristin Baumann! I am a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> with 3+ years practical experience in developing web applications.
- I successfully studied <strong>Computational Visualistics</strong>, which provided me with a profound computer science background and let me discover my passion for any kind of visual presentation, like building <strong>beautiful modern web applications</strong> or code complex <strong>data visualisations</strong>.
- I am a <strong>highly ambitious</strong> person, which motivates me to constantly <strong>improve my skills</strong>. Code-wise this means I am currently deep diving into the JavaScript Framework <strong>ReactJS</strong>.
- I try to see as much as possible of the world behind my computer screen, so I worked abroad in Australia and am right now <strong>living in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong>.
