While I was building a [landing page for an event](http://www.kristin-baumann.com/#project-reackathon){:target="_blank"} recently, I noticed that I would love to have a running timer stating how many days, hours and minutes are left until this awesome event will take place. Since I chose to build the page quickly with react, I searched for react countdown components. I didn't find any component that could get the task done, so I wrote my own little component, called **react-countdown**.


**Demo:** Find out how many days, hours, minutes and seconds are left until Christmas Eve! [http://countdown2christmas.kristin-baumann.com/](http://countdown2christmas.kristin-baumann.com/){:target="_blank"}

Update 28.12.2016: This countdown component is now also part of [neal-react](https://github.com/dennybritz/neal-react){:target="_blank"}, a collection of react components to easily build landing pages.
