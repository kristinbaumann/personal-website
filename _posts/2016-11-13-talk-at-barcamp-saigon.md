Yesterday I had the pleasure to speak at the [Barcamp Saigon 2016](http://www.barcampsaigon.org/){:target="_blank"} at the RMIT University in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. With more than 1000 registered participants and about 80 announced topics in 2016, this *unconference* is definitely one of the biggest in Vietnam.

In the spirit of a barcamp the topic of a talk could be anything that you would like to share. Since this means the audience is very diverse in their backgrounds, I chose not to speak about a tech-related, but a general topic.
I spoke about my experiences in hiring Vietnamese frontend developers and how I felt that different cultural understandings between Western interviewers and Vietnamese candidates affect the hiring process from writing CVs to passing interviews.

*Talk Title:*  **How to Get a Job at a Western Company - Understanding Cultural Differences**  
*Talk Description:*  Applying for a job and sitting in a job interview is difficult. Especially when you apply for a position in a western company where people with a different cultural understanding might interview you. Their decision on your application is based on different aspects.
This talk tries to explain these cultural differences and helps you to improve your interview performance.

Here a few more pictures:
