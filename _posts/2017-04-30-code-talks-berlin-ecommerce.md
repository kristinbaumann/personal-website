Over the past two days I was attending the 2nd [code.talks commercespecial](https://commerce.codetalks.de/en){:target="_blank"}. 

This conference takes place in the heart of Berlin in the Kulturbrauerei, a historical brewery now turned into an event venue. The talks were given in the CineStar cinema, so you could listen to the speakers while seating in super comfy seats and eating popcorn.

The code.talks smaller sister in Berlin mainly addresses developers from the ecommerce scene. The two days were fully packed with about 70 sessions parallel in 5 cinema halls in different theme tracks, like *Systems*, *Architecture*, *Recommendation/Search* or *UX/Frontend/Mobile*. You could feel the international orientation since about 50% of the talks were held in English.

As predestinated for an ecommerce conference a few big players in this domain presented talks to current or permanent topics, e.g. Zalando, ProjectA, Otto, shopping24, Spryker, AboutYou. For example, like in the year before the subject of Microservices was popular. A panel discussion tried to find out what's beyond traditional ecommerce plattforms. Furthermore topics like machine learning and artificial intelligence opened up another perspective of the ecommerce area.

I was very happy to be invited as a speaker in the track *UI / Frontend / Mobile* with the topic of isomorphic (or also called universal) JavaScript. The isomorphic frontend application combines the classic web application with the single-page application and therefore merges serverside and clientside rendering. This means the first rendering of the frontend app happens on the server and every subsequent request is handled on the client. This concept yields multiple advantages by default: a fast initial page load, a high responsiveness on page transitions and a good setup for SEO. All these features are essential for every ecommerce application. After the theoretical part, I showed a practical example on how to share the view layer using ReactJS and ExpressJS.

You can check out the [view layer code example](https://github.com/kristinbaumann/isomorphic-react-express-simplified){:target="_blank"} on my [Github account](https://github.com/kristinbaumann){:target="_blank"}, as well as more isomorphic examples with [routing using React Router](https://github.com/kristinbaumann/isomorphic-react-express-routing){:target="_blank"} or [data handling using Redux](https://github.com/kristinbaumann/isomorphic-react-express-routing-redux){:target="_blank"}.

In summary, I enjoyed the code.talks commercespecial very much. I met a bunch of new people from my new home Berlin and gained a few new insights, especially in architecture and the design to development process that I will follow up now. But since this conference is aiming at developers, there should be more developers in relation to business and sales people. So guys, if you are a dev: get out there, talk and share your knowledge!
